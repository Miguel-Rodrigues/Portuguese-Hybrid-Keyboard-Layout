pt_abnt2_105 - pt_abnt2_104
============

(NOT READY YET)

The pt_abnt2_104 and pt_abnt2_105 layouts by miguel Rodrigues. Skeleton template forked from abbeyanke/se_sv_dvorak

This keyboard derives from ABNT2 portuguese brazilian keyboards, adapted for 104 Keys US International and 105 Keys European Portuguese keyboards, as it is more convenient for both programming and writing.

This is for physical keyboards.

This has only been tested with a generic US International bluetooth keyboard and usb portuguese keyboards on my Xiaomi Note 10 Pro. Please report any issues and suggestions to me.

After installing the package, connect your keyboard and go to settings > language & input > your keyboard: choose Portuguese ABNT2 (105 keys) or Portuguese ABNT2 (104 keys)
